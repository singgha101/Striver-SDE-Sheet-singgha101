# Striver-SDE-Sheet-singgha101
I've alomost done with the Striver SDE sheet. I've attached the google sheet link of my sheet. You will get the link of each question topic wise.. along with small proper hint or explanation. It's easy to understand and use and I sure it will help you to solve a problem and building new approaches.  Also I have added daily leetcode challenge problems and some problems of some leetcode contests. These extras are below the sheet. You don't need to folllow them actually. But it's a good thing if you are doing.

Note: I'll be keep adding problems along with small proper hints and explanation. At first don't directly read them. First you try with your own if you are having trouble then only take a look and try to implement atleast. I guess it'll save your time. You don't need to watch videos on youtube.
